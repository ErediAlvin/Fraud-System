## 1. Introduction & Scope

The Digital School Feeding Management Platform (DSFMP) manages government subsidies, donor funding, and food supply chains for primary and secondary schools across Kenya. The **DSFMP Fraud Detection Module** provides automated, intelligent, and tamper-resilient oversight to eliminate four primary fraud vectors:
1. **Ghost Beneficiaries:** Fictitious or duplicate student registrations inflating meal claims.
2. **Payment & Subsidy Fraud:** Irregular transactions, split payments, round-number velocity spikes, and off-hour subsidy releases.
3. **Supply Chain & Procurement Anomalies:** Inflated delivery quantities, ghost deliveries, supplier-school collusion, and procurement monopolies.
4. **Record Tampering & Unauthorized Modifications:** Post-hoc alteration of transaction databases or beneficiary registers.

The system employs a **hybrid architecture** combining a multi-model **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection Layer** (watching behavioral patterns) and a **Permissioned Blockchain Integrity Layer** (guaranteeing cryptographic record immutability).

The system requirements identified for this project are presented in the following subsections.

- **Trigger:** User submits email, password, and TOTP verification code.
- **Expected Behavior:** The system shall validate user credentials against salted bcrypt password hashes. If valid, the system shall require and verify a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) compliant with RFC 6238 before issuing short-lived JSON Web Tokens (Access Token: 30 minutes, Refresh Token: 7 days).
- **Output:** Authenticated user session with specific role claims and redirect to the appropriate dashboard view.
- **Exceptions:** Invalid credentials, unverified 2FA token, or inactive account status returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

  The system shall classify the entity into one of four operational risk tiers:
  - **CRITICAL** ($\ge 0.80$): Auto-generate high-priority alert and flag entity for immediate freeze.
  - **HIGH** ($0.60 - 0.79$): Auto-generate alert queued for senior fraud analyst review.
  - **MEDIUM** ($0.40 - 0.59$): Flag record for watchlist monitoring over a 7-day window.

- **Verification Method:** Offline model evaluation using cross-validation test splits.

#### NFR-11: Model Transparency & Explainability
- **Requirement:** For every alert generated with a score $\ge 0.60$, the system shall compute and return top contributing feature weights (e.g., "Disbursement amount 4.2x above 30-day average", "Delivery quantity 35% below expected ration"), providing human investigators with plain-language rationale.
